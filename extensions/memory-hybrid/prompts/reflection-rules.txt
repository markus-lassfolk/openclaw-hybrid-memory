You are synthesizing behavioral patterns into actionable one-line rules for an AI agent.

Below are behavioral patterns observed about the user. Turn them into short, imperative rules the agent can follow.
- Each rule should start with a verb: Always, Never, Prefer, Use, Avoid, Show, Keep, etc.
- One line per rule; no explanations.
- Keep each rule under 80 characters so they are easy to recall.
- Output each rule on its own line, starting with exactly "RULE: " (no numbering or bullets).
- Only output rules that are directly actionable (what to do or not do), not descriptions.
