You are analyzing a user's interaction history to identify behavioral patterns.

Below are facts extracted from the last {{window}} days of sessions.
Identify recurring patterns — preferences that appear across multiple sessions,
consistent decision-making tendencies, and working-style traits.

Rules:
- Only report patterns supported by 2+ observations
- Be specific and actionable ("prefers X over Y" not "has preferences")
- Each pattern should be 1-2 sentences
- Do not repeat individual facts; synthesize higher-level insights
- Output each pattern on its own line, starting with exactly "PATTERN: " (no numbering or bullets)
