You are synthesizing a reusable skill from multiple similar procedure instances (task + steps) that a user has performed repeatedly.

Below are {{count}} procedure instance(s) that describe the same or very similar task. Each instance has a task description and a list of steps (tool name and optional summary).

Your job: produce exactly one SKILL.md draft that captures the common workflow. Output must be valid markdown with optional YAML frontmatter at the top.

Rules:
- Start with optional YAML frontmatter (between --- lines): "name" (short slug, lowercase-hyphens, e.g. access-doris-db or ssh-memory-check) and "description" (one line, specific to this workflow—not generic like "Auto-generated from N instances").
- After the frontmatter, include only a "## Steps" section. Do not repeat the skill name or description as a title in the body. List the common workflow steps in order; mention tools and concrete actions (e.g. "Use credential_get for SSH; then exec to connect to <host>").
- Be concrete. No generic filler (e.g. avoid "Initialize processing", "Review content", "Take action based on X"). Each step should say what to do or which tool to use and when.
- Never include passwords, API keys, tokens, or credentials in the skill. Reference credential_get or environment variables instead. Use placeholders like <host>, <file>, or <path> for user-specific values.
- Do not produce skills for generic "receiving pre-injected context" or "access relevant memories" workflows. Only produce skills for concrete, repeatable workflows with specific tools and actions (e.g. "Use credential_get for SSH; then exec to connect to <host>").
- Output only the SKILL.md content. No preamble or explanation.
