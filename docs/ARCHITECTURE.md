# Architecture — Hybrid Memory System

Overview of the four-part memory architecture, workspace layout, and bootstrap file design.

## Full Hybrid Architecture

Four components work together:

| Component | What it handles | Agent action | Technology |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| **1a. Structured facts** | "What's X's Y?" — precise lookups | None (auto); or `lookup` / tools | memory-hybrid: **SQLite + FTS5** |
| **1b. Vector recall** | "What was that thing?" — fuzzy semantic | None (auto); or `memory_store` / `memory_recall` | memory-hybrid: **LanceDB** + OpenAI embeddings |
| **2. Semantic file search** | "Where did I write about X?" | None (automatic) | **memorySearch**: SQLite + BM25/vector over `memory/**/*.md` |
| **3. Hierarchical files** | "Where are we on this project?" | Manual read/write | **memory/** directory + **MEMORY.md** index |

**memory-hybrid plugin** (one plugin, two backends): SQLite+FTS5 for fast, free structured fact lookup; LanceDB for semantic conversation recall. Both auto-capture and auto-recall. **memorySearch** indexes all `memory/**/*.md` files for on-demand semantic search. **MEMORY.md** is the lightweight index (~1.5k tokens) loaded every session; detail lives in `memory/` and is drilled into on demand.

**Token discipline:** Bootstrap files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, etc.) are loaded every turn — keep them lean. Put reference data in `memory/**/*.md` so it's only loaded when relevant.

## Prerequisites (API keys and models)

- **OpenAI API key (required).** The memory-hybrid plugin needs an OpenAI API key for embeddings. Without it, the plugin throws at config load and does not register.
  - **Embeddings:** Used for vector search (LanceDB), auto-recall, storing new facts, and CLI features (find-duplicates, consolidate). Default model: `text-embedding-3-small`.
  - **Optional LLM features:** Auto-classify, summarize-when-over-budget, and consolidate use the same key with a **chat** model (default `gpt-4o-mini`).
- **memorySearch** also needs an OpenAI embedding provider/model if enabled; typically the same key and model.
- **No other embedding/LLM providers** are supported; there is no automatic failover.

## Workspace Directory Structure

Create this under your OpenClaw workspace (e.g. `~/.openclaw/workspace/`):

```text
workspace/
├── AGENTS.md              # Agent behaviour + Memory Protocol (every session)
├── SOUL.md                # Agent personality & tone (every session)
├── USER.md                # User profile (every session)
├── TOOLS.md               # Behavioural rules, quick refs (every session)
├── HEARTBEAT.md           # Periodic task checklist (every session)
├── IDENTITY.md            # Agent name/emoji (every session)
├── MEMORY.md              # Root index → links to memory/ (every session)
└── memory/
    ├── people/            # User & team profiles (permanent)
    ├── projects/          # Active project state (review every 180 days)
    ├── technical/         # Systems, APIs, integrations (review every 180 days)
    ├── companies/         # Organisation intel
    ├── decisions/         # Decision logs (YYYY-MM.md)
    ├── archive/           # Completed projects (move from projects/ when done)
    └── YYYY-MM-DD.md      # Daily logs (optional)
```

**Plugin data (memory-hybrid):** By default stores its DBs under `~/.openclaw/memory/` (SQLite `facts.db`, LanceDB dir). These are separate from the workspace `memory/` folder.

## What Goes Where

| Content Type | Location | Loaded When |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Agent personality, tone, boundaries | `SOUL.md` | Every session (bootstrap) |
| User preferences, identity | `USER.md` | Every session (bootstrap) |
| Behavioural rules, voice rules, formatting | `TOOLS.md` | Every session (bootstrap) |
| Memory index (lightweight pointers) | `MEMORY.md` | Every session (bootstrap) |
| Periodic task checklist | `HEARTBEAT.md` | Every session (bootstrap) |
| Agent name/emoji | `IDENTITY.md` | Every session (bootstrap) |
| Behaviour + Memory Protocol | `AGENTS.md` | Every session (bootstrap) |
| Technical reference (APIs, IPs, auth) | `memory/technical/*.md` | On-demand (semantic search or explicit read) |
| Project status & roadmaps | `memory/projects/*.md` | On-demand |
| People profiles | `memory/people/*.md` | On-demand |
| Decision records | `memory/decisions/*.md` | On-demand |
| Daily session logs | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | On-demand |
| Isolated facts, conversation fragments | memory-hybrid plugin (SQLite + LanceDB) | Auto-injected via autoRecall |

## Bootstrap vs Memory Files

**Bootstrap files** (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md) are loaded into the system prompt **every turn**. They consume context tokens constantly. Keep them **lean**, **actionable**, and **pointer-rich**.

**Memory files** (`memory/**/*.md`) are indexed by semantic search and loaded **on demand**. They can be detailed, reference-heavy, and larger — no per-turn cost until relevant.

**Rule of thumb:** If you'd need it in every conversation → bootstrap file. If you'd need it only when working on X → memory file.

**Rules:**

- Update **MEMORY.md** whenever you add or change a file under `memory/`.
- Keep **MEMORY.md** under ~3k tokens.
- **Active Context** in MEMORY.md: list 2–5 "always load" detail files. Rotate based on what's active.

| File | Purpose | Keep small? |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **AGENTS.md** | Behaviour, safety, tools, Memory Protocol (see [MEMORY-PROTOCOL.md](MEMORY-PROTOCOL.md)) | Yes |
| **SOUL.md** | Personality, tone, boundaries | Yes |
| **USER.md** | User identity, preferences | Yes |
| **TOOLS.md** | Voice rules, formatting, index to `memory/technical/` | Yes |
| **MEMORY.md** | Index of `memory/` (Active Context, People, Projects, Technical, Decisions, Archive) | Yes — ~1.5–3k tokens |
| **HEARTBEAT.md** | Periodic checklist | Yes |
| **IDENTITY.md** | Agent name, emoji, one-line vibe | Yes |
